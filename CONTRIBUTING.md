## Language used
As you had look on the github repository, this project used Python language. You need to install Python 3.10.x

- You can find [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/) the windows/linux executable for Python 3.10.x

Why we used this version and not an other ? 
Because, this is a higher version then `pygame` can support, also, we have new syntax which include `match` syntax, ect ...

## Environment recommended
I used `Pycharm` which is an IDE of Jetbrain which support the Python (and other extra language)

So, maybe is cool to set all people who contribute this project to use `Pycharm` but you're free to choice other IDE environment.

## Librairies needed
I `requirements.txt` exist for life simplify to install all dependencies (on `fr/naulan/supermariobros/requirements.txt`)

You've plugin into `Pycharm` to install for support `requirements.txt` file (`Pycharm` propose you the plugin, don't worry)

## How to contribute ?
You need to check the `github project` and choice a `issue`, talk with other people for informing your attribution at an `issue` and let's start to create a
personnal branch for start to coding. **PLS CREATE ALWAYS A PULL REQUEST !**

After that, me and all contributor we going to review your pull request and suggest to change something wrong or not.

When all reviewer is done and ok with your code, we can merge you branch on `develop` or `master`.
